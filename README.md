## 🧩 Overview

This project explores **mental image reconstruction from brain activity**, focusing on decoding mental imagery using a **deep neural network-based Bayesian framework**. The approach leverages functional brain data (e.g., fMRI) to reconstruct visual representations seen or imagined by subjects.

The implementation is based on the concepts described in the paper:

## 🔬 Key Concepts

- **Neural Decoding**: Mapping brain activity patterns to perceptual or cognitive states.
- **DNN-Based Feature Space**: Using pre-trained deep neural networks (e.g., VGG, AlexNet) to extract and decode image features from brain signals.
- **Bayesian Estimation**: Reconstructing mental images by probabilistic sampling in the DNN feature space.
- **fMRI Data**: Functional MRI signals are used to decode visual or imagined stimuli.
